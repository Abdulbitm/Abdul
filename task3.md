**By Referring to C-based Lab videos and RISC-V-based lab videos**

**Snapshots of the compiled C code and RISC-V**

**Step 1: check whether the leafpad is installed in ur machine by using the commands
leafpad sum1ton.c& (sum1ton.c is the file name)
If the leafpad editor is opened without any errors then type the C code.**
****If the leafpad is not installed in ur machine then install by using the following command**

**sudo snap install leafpad****
![leafpad_install](https://github.com/Abdulbitm/Abdul/assets/160620896/a81bfafd-246c-44d5-85bf-2bf4092517d3)

****Step 2: Writing the C code in the leafpad editor** using the following command

**leafpad sum1ton.c&**
![Leafpad_editor](https://github.com/Abdulbitm/Abdul/assets/160620896/ed488618-98bb-4de7-85f3-8aff1329d465)

**Step 3: After writing the C code save the editor by Ctrl+s**

**Step 4: Check for the errors by using the following command(compilation step)**

**gcc sum1ton.c**
![complie the C Code](https://github.com/Abdulbitm/Abdul/assets/160620896/982d5fe6-b150-4535-9611-8478a12165ae)

**Step 5: Check the output by using the command**

**./a.out**
![C Code Execution with results ](https://github.com/Abdulbitm/Abdul/assets/160620896/07457616-fb58-4bb1-9c1f-dd32f256625b)

**The results will be displayed as** 

**Sum of numbers from 1 to 500 is 125250**
